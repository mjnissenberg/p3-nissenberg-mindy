        <p>This is where I am going to write something about the programs that UFLI offers. Some are grant-funded, some are partnerships with other school districts, so so many things. I have to amke sure to replace this placeholder text with something that sounds really good. Perhaps Kristi will help me brainstorm some ideas.</p>

                <p>UFLI works to improve literacy outcomes for students who struggle to learn to read and write. They have created several tutoring and instructional models that target the needs of struggling readers as well as provide effective Tier 1 instruction for the entire class. The UFLI Intensive Intervention is designed for one-on-one work with students with dyslexia. UFLI Basic is a one-on-one tutoring model for working with emerging readers. UFLI Small-Group was designed to address the same literacy difficulties as the UFLI Tutoring for Beginning Readers program, but with groups of three to five students, rather than one-on-one.</p>
