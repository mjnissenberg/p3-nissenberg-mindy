        <h1 class="h1">UF Literacy Institute</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the University of Florida Literacy Institute (UFLI, pronounced "you fly"). UFLI is an ongoing effort by UF faculty, students, and staff to improve literacy outcomes for children who struggle to read by addressing two key areas: teacher development and reader development. The place where those areas overlap ... that is where the work of UFLI lives. <span>Essentially, we teach teachers how to teach children to read.</span></p>

        <p>UFLI is committed to helping preservice teachers and practicing educators gain the knowledge and skills they need to provide highly effective literacy instruction to their students. In addition to the various academic and grant-funded we run, we offer many that are freely available to any teacher who wishes to help them in their practice. </p>

          <h2>About the Science of Reading</h2>
          <p>The work of UFLI is founded in the science of reading. The term “science of reading” refers to the research that reading experts have conducted on how we learn to read. This body of knowledge, including research from the fields of education, linguistics, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience, has formed the basis of what we know to comprise effective reading instruction in that it is explicit, systematic, and offer many opportunities to respond.</p>
